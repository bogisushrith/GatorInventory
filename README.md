# GatorInventory
## Problem Statement

Managing inventory manually or across disconnected tools leads to inefficiencies, data errors, and poor visibility into stock levels. Small teams and businesses often struggle to track what items they have, update quantities in real time, and quickly locate specific products - resulting in overstocking, stockouts, and wasted time. GatorInventory solves this by providing a centralized, easy-to-use platform where users can add, update, delete, and search inventory items through a clean web interface, backed by a secure and reliable REST API.
