# GatorInventory

GatorInventory is a web-based inventory management system developed as a team project for our Software Engineering course. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a simple system that helps users manage and organize inventory items in an efficient manner.

The application allows users to perform basic inventory operations such as adding new items, viewing existing items, updating item details, and removing items from the inventory. Through this project, we apply fundamental software engineering concepts including requirement analysis, system design, modular development, and version control using GitHub.
